              On Jan. 27, 2017, President Trump issued an executive order suspending immigrant and non-immigrant admissions to the U.S. for at least 90 days for individuals from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.
            </p>
            <p>
              On Feb. 3, a federal judge in Seattle issued a ruling that temporarily blocks President Trump&#39;s order from being enforced nationwide. And on Feb. 5, a federal appeals court rejected a request by the Justice Department to restore the executive order.

              In a message to the university community, Northeastern President Joseph E. Aoun wrote: &#34;For the past decade, we have joined together to make Northeastern a truly global university. In doing so, we have set forth a series of core values such as the value of inclusivity and a bedrock belief that diversity makes our community stronger. I find the president&#39;s executive order restricting international travel to be antithetical to our core values and completely unacceptable. I say this as an educator and as an American who came to this country as an international student.&#34;
            <p>
              Northeastern welcomes students from all over the world. This site is intended to communicate the resources available to our students and the advocacy work of the university on behalf of its community of global citizens.
